# 🎨 CeramiCo Project

**CeramiCo** is my graduation project for **Social Hackers Academy**.

With a background in Fine Arts and a love for working with clay, I originally envisioned opening a physical pottery studio. But discovering Full Stack Development opened a new creative path — this platform blends both passions: **pottery and programming**.
