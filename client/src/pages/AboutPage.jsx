          This website was created as part of a <strong>graduation project at Socialhackers Academy</strong>, aiming to combine the beauty of handmade pottery with modern e-commerce. As part of my journey as a developer, I wanted to create an online experience that merges art and technology, allowing people to discover the magic of pottery.

          The stunning handmade products featured on CeramiCo are sourced from <a href="https://www.giftedartisan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500">Gifted Artisan</a>, a platform that celebrates and promotes talented artisans who create authentic, handcrafted pottery. These products are crafted with love, care, and skill, and each piece tells a unique story.
